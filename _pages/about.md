Hello, I’m **Rumman Ahmed Prodhan**, a passionate researcher and educator in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), with a strong focus on healthcare applications. Currently, I am a **Lecturer** at the **Department of Computer Science & Engineering** at Northern University Bangladesh, where I teach and supervise projects in AI, machine learning, and software development.

My journey in computer science began with a deep fascination for problem-solving and technology. I earned my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Engineering** from the **University of Asia Pacific**, graduating with distinction and securing five Vice Chancellor’s Awards and a Dean’s Award. My academic excellence was complemented by my undergraduate thesis, **"Emotion Recognition from Facial Expression and Brain Signals,"** which ignited my passion for applying AI to complex challenges in healthcare.

### Research Interests
My research focuses on:
- **AI and Machine Learning for Healthcare**: Developing intelligent systems that support healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating patients, with a focus on emotion recognition and mental health.
- **Image Processing and Signal Processing**: Using advanced AI techniques for analyzing images and signals, particularly in medical applications such as EEG and brain signal analysis.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: Exploring how technology can be used to bridge the gap between healthcare providers and patients.
- **Deep Learning**: Leveraging deep learning models for both image and signal processing tasks, with applications in healthcare and other fields.

I have co-authored multiple journal and conference papers, including **"M1M2: Deep Learning-Based Real-Time Emotion Recognition from Neural Activity,"** published in MDPI Sensors, and **"Optimal EEG Electrode Set for Emotion Recognition,"** presented at the **4th International Conference on Activity and Behavior Computing**. These projects allowed me to collaborate with distinguished researchers, gaining invaluable insights into the intersection of AI and healthcare.

### Industry Experience
I have practical experience in deploying AI-based solutions in industrial settings. During my internship at Bondstein Technologies Limited, I developed a **real-time fault detection system** using Raspberry Pi and computer vision for conveyor belts in the British American Tobacco production line.

### Teaching and Mentoring
As a lecturer, I am committed to fostering the next generation of computer scientists. I supervise several research projects, including **pediatric teeth segmentation using transfer learning**, **subject-independent emotion recognition using EEG signals**, and **real-time emotion recognition systems**. These projects are aimed at advancing the role of AI in improving healthcare outcomes.

### Future Goals
I am currently preparing to pursue a **PhD in Computer Science & Engineering**, focusing on **AI, Image Processing, Signal Processing, and healthcare technologies**. I aspire to develop AI-driven solutions that make healthcare more accessible and effective, especially in underprivileged communities. By combining AI with big data analytics, I aim to bridge the gap between healthcare providers and patients, improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

### Let’s Connect
I am always open to collaboration and discussions on interdisciplinary projects that explore the potential of AI, image processing, and signal processing in solving real-world problems.
