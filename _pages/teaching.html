<h2>Courses Conducted</h2>

<p>I have been a <strong>Lecturer</strong> in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Northern University Bangladesh since <strong>September 2022</strong>. I conduct courses in various areas of Computer Science, with a focus on practical applications of Artificial Intelligence, Database Systems, and Software Development. The courses I have conducted include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Expert System</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Database Management Systems</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Computer Architecture</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Software Development</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>These courses involve practical sessions, theoretical insights, and project-based learning to prepare students for real-world challenges in the field of computer science.</p>

<h2>Research-Based Supervision</h2>

<p>In addition to teaching, I supervise several undergraduate research projects focused on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve healthcare-related problems. Current research projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pediatric Teeth Segmentation from Dental Radiographs Using Transfer Learning</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Subject-Independent Emotion Recognition from Brain Waves Using EEG Signals</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Project-Based Supervision</h2>

<p>I also guide students through software development and system design projects as part of their undergraduate coursework. These projects emphasize building practical solutions for real-world problems. Notable student projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Autism Care Network â€“ An Online-Based Academic Platform for Autistic Children</strong></li>
  <li><strong>NUB Online Exam System</strong></li>
</ul>
