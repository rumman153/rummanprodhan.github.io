### Courses Conducted

I have been a **Lecturer** in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Northern University Bangladesh since **September 2022**. I conduct courses in various areas of Computer Science, with a focus on practical applications of Artificial Intelligence, Database Systems, and Software Development. The courses I have conducted include:

- **Artificial Intelligence and Expert System**
- **Database Management Systems**
- **Computer Architecture**
- **Software Development**

These courses involve practical sessions, theoretical insights, and project-based learning to prepare students for real-world challenges in the field of computer science.

### Research-Based Supervision

In addition to teaching, I supervise several undergraduate research projects focused on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve healthcare-related problems. Current research projects include:

- **Pediatric Teeth Segmentation from Dental Radiographs Using Transfer Learning**
- **Subject-Independent Emotion Recognition from Brain Waves Using EEG Signals**
- **Real-time Emotion Recognition and Attendance System for Classes Using Raspberry Pi**

### Project-Based Supervision

I also guide students through software development and system design projects as part of their undergraduate coursework. These projects emphasize building practical solutions for real-world problems. Notable student projects include:

- **Autism Care Network â€“ An Online-Based Academic Platform for Autistic Children**
- **NUB Online Exam System**
- **Gym Management System**
